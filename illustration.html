                    <a href="display/images/KIRBY N VENASUAR.png" class="openModal" data-description="This 2021 personal illustration merges the worlds of Kirby and Pokemon, reflecting the significant impact video games have had on my artistic interests since childhood, particularly titles like Pokemon, MegaMan, Kirby, and Sonic. Initially inspired by replicating game box art, this project became a tribute to influential characters through franchise crossovers. The piece depicts Kirby playfully drawing on a resting Venusaur, who doesn't mind at all, aiming to create a charming and lighthearted scene.">

                    <a href="display/images/frog.png" class="openModal" data-description="I created this illustration in 2022 to show how my art skills have grown. I came up with the idea of a girl wearing a huge frog hoodie, which I thought would be fun and cute. To keep things focused, I used only shades of grey, playing with light and shadow to make it look real. This helps you see how the girl and the big hoodie work together, emphasizing the playful vibe. Basically, this piece shows I love making fun, creative pictures, and I had a blast drawing it.">

Again making use of video game franchises that have  inspired me, as a conduit to share how I felt during the time. I was sincerely feeling lethargic and I wanted to depict that with two characters that represent lethargy. Hilda being from Fire Emblem: Three Houses(2019) and Slaking from Pokemon. I merged both of these characters looking aloof. I was content with how this piece came out.
