This detailed project presented a significant challenge initially, but as I became more comfortable with the Blender interface, I gained the confidence to experiment. The final result was a blueberry galaxy donut, a dessert concept that has not yet been adopted by Krispy Kreme haha.">

I chose my girlfriend's mug as inspiration and was very pleased with the accuracy of the digital model compared to the real object. This project significantly boosted my confidence in using Blender, and I am particularly proud of the result.

                <li><a href="display/images/P4 - Apartment - Shams F.png" class="openModal" data-description="The final project involved designing a makeshift apartment room containing various items of interest. Notably, two previously completed projects were subtly incorporated into this design, placed casually on the central coffee table.

The project aimed to demonstrate proficiency in Blender and the application of color theory principles through lighting manipulation. The depicted apartment room was intended to represent a temporarily unoccupied space on an overcast day.

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Howdy! I am Shams Fassassi, a fledling developer, 3D modeler, and illustrator. 
            I am currently a student at the University of Maryland Global Campus, studying Web Development and Computer Science. 
            I have a passion for creating and learning new things, and I am always looking for new challenges to tackle. In my free time, 
            I enjoy playing video games, reading books, and powerlifting. I hope to take this knowledge and apply it to development jobs in the future.
