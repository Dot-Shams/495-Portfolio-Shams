        <p>
            Howdy, I'm SmashdotPNG (all in lower-case because I like that aesthetic).
            I'm an illustrator who started to draw around the age of 8. I was heavy inspired by video games such as Megaman X and Sonic the Hedgehog and anime such as 'Rurouni Kenshin', "Yu-Yu-Hakusho", 'Gundam Wing', 'Tenchi Muyo', and 'Dragon Ball Z'. 
            <br>
            Seeing these characters on screen would make me day-dream and naturally made me want to replicate them in some way. In my time in primary school, i'd find myself sketch and doodle in the middle of class. At home, I would take blank printing paper and draw all over that. This slowly progressed into making my own short comics that I would bring to school and finish there.
            <br>

            Since then, the flame that is my interest in art has grown and shrunk due to a variety of factors, but, it has never and won't ever go out. 
            <br>
            I love to create, build, and help others, which is why I made this website.
            <br>
            This is also why I have opened a <a href="commissions.html">Commission Portal</a> where if you need an idea fleshed out, I'm your man!
