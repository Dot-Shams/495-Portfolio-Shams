            On Returns
        </h2>

        <p>All sales are final on commissions.
            <br> 
            Returns may be initiated due to quality control (QC) issues on stickers and prints.

        <h2>
            On Commissions
        </h2>
        <p>
            Commissions will be completed within 2-3 weeks of approval and payment. 
        <br>
        <strong> In the instance that it takes longer than 2-3 weeks, I will update you via the email you've supplied.</strong>
        <br>    
        Commissions must be approved by me and the client(you). This means, interaction between you and I and finalizing design ideas. 
        <br>    
        Commission changes cannot be made after a commission has been approved.
